    <h2>Hello,</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a resident (he/him) of the beautiful country of Belgium, and this
        website serves as a minimalistic online presence for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        While there
        isn't much to see here, and this website isn't the most fancy out there 
        - that's because I like simplicity - 
        feel free to explore and get a glimpse into my digital corner.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is intentionally kept discreet to maintain privacy, but
        I appreciate your visit nonetheless. If you have any inquiries or just
        want to say hello, you can drop me a line <a asp-controller="Contact" asp-action="Index" asp-route-culture="@CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name" title="Contact">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for stopping by!
    </p>
